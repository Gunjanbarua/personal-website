I am a Geospatial Data Scientist and Ph.D. Candidate in the Geospatial and Environmental Analysis Program at Virginia Tech. My research lies at the intersection of precision forestry, remote sensing, LiDAR, and Artificial Intelligence. From advancing yield predictions in <em>Pinus taeda</em> to developing machine learning-based MRV systems for carbon credit marketplaces with CarboBon, my work utilizes advanced spatial algorithms to solve complex environmental challenges.
